# leaflet-challenge
This was completed by Carter Kioski

In this assignment, I am hitting an API to get information about earthquakes from around the world.  With this info, I am utilizing leaflet.js to plot the earthquakes on the map with circles that change shape based on the magnitude of each earthquake.  Clicking on the earthquake circle provides more detail about the earthquake.
